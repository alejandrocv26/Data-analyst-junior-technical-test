Technical Assessment – Data Analysis Solution

This repository contains my solution to a Junior Data Scientist technical test for an e-commerce company.
The assessment was implemented in two formats – Python and Excel.

The recruiter’s feedback was positive and highlighted that my approach and performance were commendable. I’m sharing this here to document my process and to showcase my skills in both tools.

🛠 Tools Used

Python (data cleaning, analysis, automation, reproducibility)

Excel (manual data exploration, pivot tables, visualization)

🔑 Key Features

Data Cleaning & Preparation: Ensured dataset consistency and handled missing/duplicate values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarized key metrics, trends, and insights.

Comparison of Tools: Delivered the same solution using Python scripts and Excel workflows.

Reproducibility: The Python script can be executed to replicate results automatically.
